#### NOTICE
This is in testing... It works on two very different projects. I'd love people to try it out and provide feedback.

## Overview
The idea is simple. You provide TS-Service-Worker with a **Plan** (and options), and it outputs a functional Javascript file that can be sent to the browser. The **Plan** is a series of caching strategies to be applied, along with the paths they should be applied to.

## Examples

The very simplest service worker might provide an offline backup of the whole site:
```ts
import {requestHandler, Origin} from "ts-service-worker";

export const plan: Plan = [
  {paths: Origin, strategy: "networkFirst"} // don't do this!
]
app.get('/service-worker.js', requestHandler(plan))
```
This plan says, "intercept all the requests from the root of the site and below (everything under `/`), and serve them from the network if available; otherwise, serve from the cache." This is just one of the example caching strategies, and demonstrates:

- declarative configuration
- conveniences like `Origin` that make doing simple things simple
- how a simple caching strategy is insufficent. (shrug)

Some of the deficiences of this strategy:
- it only caches paths that have been visited
- provides no way to update cached files
- caches everything fetched, even unimportant resources

A real caching plan requires more nuance. Here is part of a slightly more realistic plan:
```ts
export const plan: Plan = 
  [
    {strategy: 'networkOnly', paths: ['/open-search.xml']},
    {strategy: 'staleWhileRevalidate', ['/my-data.json']}
    {strategy: 'staticOfflineBackup', [/.*\.html/], backup: '/networkDown.html'}
  ]
```
Here, we see multiple strategies in action. Each request is evaluated (sequentially) against the paths, and the first matching strategy is applied. (If not strategy matches, the resource is fetched as normal.)
  - The path `open-search.xml` will never be cached, 
  - `/my-data.json` will be served from the cache and re-fetched in the background, available for a later access. 
  - Finally, the file `/networkDown.html` will be cached, and served as a replacement for other HTML pages when fetching fails.

Another common strategy is to pre-cache some resources on disk. These can be explicitly listed, or dynamically determined from glob matches of files on disk:
```ts
  {
    strategy: 'cache-on-install',
    files: { glob: '*.png', dir: 'src/assets/images', prefix: '/img'}
  }
```
These are just some examples. Each app is different and requires careful consideration and crafting. **TS-Service-Worker** makes developing a custom caching service worker easy and error-free.

## Usage

After npm installing, there are a few ways to use this:

### Within Express

Using directly within Express (or equivalent) will be the most convenient and provides the best Typescript type hints:

```ts
import { requestHandler } from 'ts-service-worker'
app.get('/service-worker.js', requestHandler([
    { strategy: 'networkFirst', paths: Origin }
  ]))
})
```

### CLI

The CLI will generate the Javascript file from the specifications in a JSON file. This is nice because it's declarative, but lacks the typing of a Typescript solution.

1. Create a `sw-plan.json` file with `plan` and `options`. See below for available properties.
2. Run `> npx ts-service-worker sw-plan.json >dist/service-worker.js`
3. Serve the resultant file (`dist/service-worker.js`) as your service worker, and reference it in your HTML head.
4. Editing the JSON file and regenerate as needed.

### Other
There are other ways to incorporate this into your build cycle. The library exposes a method `generateServiceWorker` which accepts a plan and options and generates the necessary Javascript (text). Let me know how you do it! 

Note that the output of this tool needs _no_ post-processing, so it's best to avoid these tools for the service worker if possible. If the code output isn't compatible, let me know and I'll fix it right away.

### Options

The following may be provided as options for any usage method, and they effect the generation of the Javascript code:

* `version` – semantic version of the worker. Major version bump means to reset the cache.
* `skipWaiting` – executes the normal skip waiting logic, and allows your service worker to come into play without all the browser windows being closed.
* `debug` – outputs log messages as files are fetched. This is too noise for production, but may be useful to figure out what is going on with your service worker.

## Paths

Paths expressions will match URLs requested from your website, and must be included in each strategy of a plan. The path property can be:
- a string URL path. This is intepreted as the meaning the URL must END with this pattern
- a RegExp, matching the full URL
- an array of strings or RegExp, following the rules above
- the symbol `Symbol.for('origin')`, which matches everything under the service worker's domain.
- the symbol `Symbol.for('scope')`, which matches everything under the service worker's scope, which is the level that a service worker is installed at.

## Strategies

### cacheFirst

This strategy is ideal for CSS, images, fonts, JS, templates… basically anything you'd consider static to that "version" of your site. Per [https://web.dev/learn/pwa/serving/#cache-first]:
>> Using this strategy, the service worker looks for the matching request in the cache and returns the corresponding Response if it's cached. Otherwise it retrieves the response from the network (~~optionally,~~ updating the cache for future calls). If there is neither a cache response nor a network response, the request will error. Since serving assets without going to the network tends to be faster, this strategy prioritizes performance over freshness.

There is no way to remove files from the cache. For this reason, use only for immutable resources (certain images and fingerprinted assets). If these do need to be updated, you will need to [rebuild the cache (see below)](#Rebuild Cache).

### networkFirst
This is most useful to provide the user with a backup in case the network isn't available. Per [https://web.dev/learn/pwa/serving/#network-first]:

> This strategy is the mirror of the Cache First strategy; it checks if the request can be fulfilled from the network and, if it can't, tries to retrieve it from the cache. If there is neither a network response nor a cache response, the request will error. Getting the response from the network is usually slower than getting it from the cache, this strategy prioritizes updated content instead of performance.

### staleWhileRevalidate

This is useful for resources that could be slow to fetch and whose freshness is not critical. Per [https://web.dev/learn/pwa/serving/#stale-while-revalidate]:

> The stale while revalidate strategy returns a cached response immediately, then checks the network for an update, replacing the cached response if one is found. This strategy always makes a network request, because even if a cached resource is found, it will try to update what was in the cache with what was received from the network, to use the updated version in the next request. This strategy, therefore, provides a way for you to benefit from the quick serving of the cache first strategy and update the cache in the background.

> With this strategy, the assets are updated in the background. This means your users won't get the new version of the assets until the next time that path is requested. At that time the strategy will again check if a new version exists and the cycle repeats.

### networkOnly

Per [https://web.dev/learn/pwa/serving/#network-only]:

> The network only strategy is similar to how browsers behave without a service worker or the Cache Storage API. Requests will only return a resource if it can be fetched from the network. This is often useful for resources like online-only API requests.

### staticOfflineBackup

Use this strategy to provide a backup for a resource only to be applied when a site is offline. This may be a "sorry" page, or could provide some reasonable alternative. This is commonly used for placeholder images or other content.

The backup resource is loaded on service worker installation and served as needed.

Note: this currently doesn't support inline SVGs that you see in some examples, but requires using a separate file.

Note: this does **not** serve the "backup" file from cache by default. If you want to do that, use another strategy like `networkFirst` in combination. 

### cache-on-install

Cache specific paths when the service worker installs. Because it needs to know specific resources, path matching wildcards and regular expression will not work. But this strategy has an extra feature that other strategies do not:  it can scan directories for resources. In some cases this, when you have a whole directory of files to pre-cache, this will be the least maintenance. Use normal glob patterns to identify these as shown below. Here's one example:

```ts
plan: Plan = [
  {
    files: {
      glob: '**/*.png',
      dir: 'src/images',  // where to start searching
      prefix: '/assets'   // prefix applied to any matches
    },
    strategy: 'cache on install'
  }
]
```
The globs are evaluated when the `service-worker.js` file is created, so updating resources will require rebuilding the service worker file.

## Cache and Versioning of Service Workers

When developing service workers, it can take a while to learn service worker behavior, understanding when it re-installs service workers and rebuilds caches. This is worth understanding, but **TS-Service-Worker** tries the appropriate controls.

#### Clearing the Cache
There are two components that relevant here:

- the service worker
- the cache (of responses)

When building your service worker, provide a `version` string in the options, follow semvar conventions. If you change this at all, the service worker will be re-installed (because it has changed). This, in itself, will _not_ affect the cached files. But, if the _major version_ changes, the cache (of responses) will be deleting and a new one created. _With this library, the way to reset the cache in users' browsers is to bump the major version number._ (To test locally, you can use the browser's developer tools.) 

That being said, you're not in complete control. Browsers will manage the actual response cache, removing items if it becomes too large. These limits are quite high in modern browsers. Some of the strategies implemented here will replace older assets with newer ones when found; some won't. This should be documented above or obvious.

#### Skip Waiting

Service workers themselves will re-install when they have changed-- based on the browsers' rules. This wil be confusing at first, though, as new service workers will not normally be installed. The default behavior for service workers is to wait until all the windows associated with the service worker are closed, and then install the new service worker. If this isn't what you want, you can accellerate this by passing `skipWaiting: true` in the options. This will install the service worker as soon as it is download-- but still will not be available as the page loads, but usually it will be ready on the next reload.

## Why TS-Service-Worker?

Service workers are a powerful tool for developers to improve the user experience, providing for fine-grained caching, offline usage and progressive web apps (PWAs). It replaced the coarse-grained _AppCache_, which proved quite hard to effectively use and was retired. 

Unfortunately, the service worker API is also hard to use, as it is quite low-level. It requires a series of nested promise chains, and quickly grows complicated. In the documentation there are good examples describing single specific strategies. While these are readable, they are minimally useful because real-world usage requires integrating several of these strategies at the same time. This can be error-prone and hard to follow. And as anyone who has developed service workers knows, they are tedious to test because of the complex lifecycle.

And since service workers run in the browser, they must be written in the browser's version Javascript. This likely involves transpilation, which will requiring additional complexity in the build process to produce a separate artifact. It can be quite challenging in a Typescript project.

There are [other libraries](#other-libraries) designed to help, which may be useful to you. **TS-Service-Worker** aims to solve specific challenges.
