eon = The largest unit of time.
era = A unit of time shorter than an eon but longer than a period.
period = A unit of time shorter than an era but longer than epoch.
epoch = A unit of time shorter than a period but longer than an age.
age =

Ma = Mega annum, i.e. million years ago before present.
Ka = Thousand years ago before present.

And instead of saying that a rock is "5 Ma old," geologists use a different abbreviation,
such as m.y., mya, myr, or Myr (all of which stand for millions of years,
in reference to age or duration).
This is a little awkward, but the context makes things clear.

CE stands for “common (or current) era”, while BCE stands for “before the common (or current) era”. These abbreviations have a shorter history than BC and AD, although they still date from at least the early 1700s.

BC should appear after the numerical year, while AD should appear before it.

1100 BC, AD 1066

BCE and CE should both appear after the numerical year.

1100 BCE, 1066 CE

As is the case with most initialisms, periods may be used after each letter.

1100 B.C., A.D. 1066, 1100 B.C.E., 1066 C.E.

Some style guides recommend writing BC, AD, BCE and CE in small caps.

Unix Epoch time




Archean = “Ancient” eon from 4,500 Mya – 2,500 Ma.
Proterozoic = “Early life” eon from 2,500 Ma – 540 Ma.
Paleozoic = “Ancient life” eon from 540 Mya – 248 Ma.
Mesozoic = “Middle life” eon from 248 Mya – 65 Ma.
Cenozoic = “Recent life” eon from 65 Mya to Present.
Holocene = “All recent” epoch from 10 Ka to Present
