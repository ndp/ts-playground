// ## Kept imports should merge into one code block
//
// When using `// keep` on imports, and they're followed by example code,
// they should be merged into a single code block, not separate blocks.
import { equal } from 'node:assert/strict' // keep
import { test as example } from 'node:test' // keep

example('combined imports and code', () => {
  // When running lit-md on this file, the imports with // keep
  // and the example code should all appear in ONE typescript code block
