# Basic Prose

In lit-md, comments become the prose sections of your markdown.
Both `//` line comments and `/* */` block comments are supported.
## Line Comments

Consecutive `//` lines merge into one paragraph.
Leave a blank `//` to start a new paragraph.

This sentence is a second paragraph.

```ts
const msg = 'line comments become markdown'
typeof msg // => 'string'
```

## Block Comments
Block comments also work.
Leading `*` characters and indentation are stripped.

```ts
const msg = 'block comments also become prose'
typeof msg // => 'string'
```

## Markdown Formatting

Comments support full Markdown: **bold**, `inline code`, and lists.

- `parse()` — extracts structure
- `render()` — emits markdown
- `example()` — creates code blocks
