# @ndp-software/lit-md

Literate test files that generate `README.md`s.

## Introduction

Some projects, especially libraries, require numerous and
detailed code examples. For those responsible for updating
a README, or other documentation, this can be burdensome
and error-prone.

With lit-md, you write your documentation with embedded code samples
that are automatically type-checked and run through node to
verify them. Every example actually works!

Key features:
- works with Typescript or Javascript
- provides utilities to include shell commands and their outputs
  as part of your documentation. This is important if you tool has
  a CLI, or you just need to show how it works in the terminal.
- supports flexible assertion methods for both code examples and shell commands,
  with options to display actual outputs in the generated markdown
- fully tested with its own test suite, which also serves as
  documentation and examples for users

There _are_ other tools with the same aims (e.g. [TwoSlash](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-Website/tree/v2/packages/ts-twoslasher)),
but this follows in the Literate programming tradition but updated
for the Typescript and TDD era. I have aimed to provide a great DX
for writing documentation, with a simple syntax and powerful features
that work well with the node ecosystem.

```sh
# You can "run" your documentation as a test:
node --test README.lit-md.ts
# You can also typecheck:
tsc README.lit-md.ts
# An it can be converted from Typescript to a plain old markdown
# README file with `lit-md`:
lit-md README.lit-md.ts        # generates README.md

# Or, you can do it all in one step with:
lit-md --test --typecheck README.lit-md.ts  # all-in-one!
```
## How it Works
A **lit-md** file contains prose in comments and examples in test bodies.
At a basic level, a file is processed and
- comments are directly transferred into markdown, and
- example (or `test`, `it`, `spec`) bodies become fenced code blocks.
To make this work well, there are quite a few nuances and features to control
what appears in the output and how it looks.

# A simple example

shellExample(`lit-md tmp.ts --out out.md`, {
  inputFiles: [{
    path: 'tmp.ts',
    displayPath: false,
    content: `
describe('My Project README.', () => {
/*
This is a really great project! 
Adding numbers is as simple as using the "+" operator:
*/
example('add example', () => {
  const a = 1
  const b = 2
  console.log(a + b) // => 3
})  

// Also supported is multiplication:
example('multiply example', () => {
  const x = 3
  const y = 4
  console.log(x * y) // => 12
})
})
`
  }],
  outputFiles: [{
    path: "out.md",
    displayPath: false,
  }]
})

  /*
  Use `shellExample` to include executable shell commands in the README.

  describe('shellExample function', () => {
    metaExample('basic: verify command succeeds', () => {
      shellExample('echo "hello world"')
    })

    // Multi-line commands can be joined with &&:
    metaExample('with stdout assertion', () => {
      shellExample('echo "hello"', {
        stdout: { contains: 'hello' }
      })
    })
